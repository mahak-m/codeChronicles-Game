 * WarriorCharacter class

 *
 * WarriorCharacter objects hold a diamond shield (guarantees victory in a battle when used).
 * The shield can be used in battle once during the game using useShield().
 *
 * Its usage is tracked through the shieldUsed attribute.
 *
 * The castSpell() method is overridden to reflect the change in WarriorCharacterâ€™s lines when in battle.
