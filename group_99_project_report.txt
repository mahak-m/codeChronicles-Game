PROCESS MARKS (40%)

User stories identified (IDs correspond to design document) and branches in GitLab repository can be easily related to user stories  (4 marks)


Retrospective notes indicate process refined/improved;  GitFlow process is stable by final iteration (4 marks) 


User stories initiated early and there is evidence of incremental commits with intuitive commit messages  (8 marks)


Merge requests/code reviews exist at each iteration (8 marks)


Incremental commits include tests (8 marks)


Incremental commits include documentation (JavaDoc)  (8 marks)
